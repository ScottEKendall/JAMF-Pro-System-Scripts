# This script should detect the names of any present specified network ports and
# configure the search domains settings accordingly.

# Based loosely off the JAMF script that does the same thing for policy compatibility reasons.

# Set variables up here
# JAMF reserves $1 to 3 for itself, so we have to use $4 onwards.
# So when calling this script, use the following fields of information:
# Field 4: Name of a Network Service
# Field 5: First search domain address. (eg. arts.local)
# Field 6: Second search domain address. (eg. arts.ac.uk)
